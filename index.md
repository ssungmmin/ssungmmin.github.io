## Sung Min Park
Hello, my name is Sungmin (pronouns: she/her) and I am a researcher at the [MoNeT](http://neuroimage.yonsei.ac.kr) (**Mo**lecular **Ne**uroimaging **T**echnology) Laboratory at Yonsei University School of Medicine, Nuclear Medicine dept. I am interested in developing novel data-driven analysis methods and my long term goal is to develop neuroimaging biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. 


I used to work as a Research Assistant at [IBIC](http://ibic.washington.edu), where I worked with [Dr. Swati Rane Levendovszky](https://sites.google.com/site/uwswatirane). 

Until recently I was in Seattle,WA as an undergraduate exchange student at <span style="color:BlueViolet">[University of Washintgon](https://www.washington.edu)</span>. After coming back to Korea, I graduated with a B.Eng in Bioconvergence, Yonsei University (Seoul, Korea) - [Underwood International College](https://uic.yonsei.ac.kr/main/default.asp).
