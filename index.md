## Sung Min Park
Hello, my name is Sungmin (pronouns: she/her) and I am a second year Imaging Science Ph.D Student at Washington University in St. Louis. My long term goal is to develop neuroimaging biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. 

- 💡[Brain Light Lab](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/biophotonics-research-center-brc/labs/eggebrecht-lab/)

- 🧠 *2020-2021* Researcher at [MoNeT](http://neuroimage.yonsei.ac.kr) (**Mo**lecular **Ne**uroimaging **T**echnology) Laboratory at Yonsei University School of Medicine (Department of Nuclear Medicine) where I used resting-state fMRI and structural MRI to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders. I used to work as a research intern at the MoNet laboratory during my undergraduate (*2018-2019*).

- 🔭 *2019-2020* Research Assistant at [Integrated Brain Imaging Center - U of Washington, Seattle, WA](http://ibic.washington.edu) and I work with [Dr. Swati Rane Levendovszky](https://sites.google.com/site/uwswatirane). I looked at brains during rest 🧠☕️ to investigate the differnece in dynamic network patterns in Cognitively normal and MCI (Mild cognitively Impaired) patients. I also worked with the [MAPP research network](https://www.mappnetwork.org/) to find neural correlates of pelvic pain. 

- 🎓 *2021* B.Eng in BioConvergence at [Yonsei University, Underwood International College](http://uic.yonsei.ac.kr).
